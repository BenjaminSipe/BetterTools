8. Add visual variants for different similar materials
    RELIES ON 3
    > Wood types:
    > Stone types:
    > Hardened stone types:
    > Gemstone types:
    > NOTE: Currently done as physical Variants, not just visual, as I'm not skilled enough to attempt to override the render engine yet.
5. Tools don't break on 0 durability.
    > Keep tools from being used when they would break.
    > Add broken texture variants ( PROBABLY NOT )
        > I might have an idea for this, what if on breaking, there was a designated broken tool for each tool material,
            This tool would an itemstack in it's nbt data for the tool it needed. Then, when Item reaches durability 0, we do the normal broken thing, and replace it with a broken tool.
            NOTE: doesn't prevent usage, simply slows mining speed, and removes right-click ability.
                Dynamically adjusting the attack damage on the fly appears quite difficult.
                I can probably do it using AttributeModifiers, but I'm not completely sure where to change them. And I need to add in repairs first.

// notes & brainstorming:
I think as far as tool variants are concerned, I don't really feel bad about adding in the variants manually.
I do need to setup the ingredient repairs.
Which will probably involve custom tags.
Which I have yet to do.
