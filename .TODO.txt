TODO list for Mod:

Current List
15. Reorganize everything by tool type because that is better I think

Backlog / Planned features:
3. Additional Tool Variants.
    > potential materials: nether brick, brick, echo-shard, terrecotta,
    > New tools:
        > Multi-tools: Mattock, Adze,
        > Weapons: Knife, Bow, crossbow, spear
        > 3x3 tools: Broad Axe, Hammer, Excavator // I might hate these.
4. Enchanting templates.
    > Add vanilla enchantment templates,
        > Templates can be applied to any tool with a diamond.
        > I've considered having lower tiers be applicable with cheaper materials. . . but I don't think so.
    > Add crafting/loot table templates,
        > I think templates can be found in loot chests.
            > Should probably figure out exactly where.
        > Templates can be duplicated identically to armor templates. But with lapis instead of diamonds.
    > Balance Mending enchantment,
    > Remove enchantments from tools repaired in crafting table.
    > Add enchantment that allows enchantments to be kept when manually repairing tools


11. Add Tool Bindings
12. Add sturdy and swift modifiers based on the tool rod used in construction.
14. Rename everything to make sense.
16. Add unstable modifier to GEMSTONE tools.


COMPLETED:
10. Make tool tip include handle material
13. Add Vanilla Tools Back
3. Partial
    > New materials:
        > Gemstones: emerald, amethyst, quartz
        > Soft stones: netherrack, sandstone, red sandstone
        > Stones: Granite, Andesite, Diorite, Tuff, Calcite, Blackstone,
        > Sharp rocks: obsidian, flint, crying_obsidian
        > Hard stones: Deepslate, endstone, Basalt,
        > Soft metals: Copper
8. Add visual variants for different similar materials
    RELIES ON 3
    > Wood types:
    > Stone types:
    > Hardened stone types:
    > Gemstone types:
    > NOTE: Currently done as physical Variants, not just visual, as I'm not skilled enough to attempt to override the render engine yet.
5. Tools don't break on 0 durability.
    > Keep tools from being used when they would break.
    > Add broken texture variants ( PROBABLY NOT )
        > I might have an idea for this, what if on breaking, there was a designated broken tool for each tool material,
            This tool would an itemstack in it's nbt data for the tool it needed. Then, when Item reaches durability 0, we do the normal broken thing, and replace it with a broken tool.
            NOTE: doesn't prevent usage, simply slows mining speed, and removes right-click ability.
                Dynamically adjusting the attack damage on the fly appears quite difficult.
                I can probably do it using AttributeModifiers, but I'm not completely sure where to change them. And I need to add in repairs first.
9. Add translations for items.
6. In crafting grid repairing. ( may not be desired )
    > Add item repairs in crafting grid
    > Cost is based on material investment in the tool. So 1 ingot will fully repair a shovel, 50% repair a sword or hoe, and 33 % repair a pick or an axe.
    > All enchantments are removed when repairing in crafting table.


// notes & brainstorming:
I think as far as tool variants are concerned, I don't really feel bad about adding in the variants manually.
I do need to setup the ingredient repairs.
Which will probably involve custom tags.
Which I have yet to do.
