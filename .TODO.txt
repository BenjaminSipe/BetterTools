Recipe Integration with a recipe provider mod.
Make tool handles data-driven.
Make tool handles control stats ( either additive or multiplicative, all? stats)
Make Mod book.
Add tool bindings.

Material
Ingredient
Handle
Binding
Modifier ? Probably no more than that.

I don't think any of the others will need a "Material" esk folder

After those, it is time for the non-vanilla changes?
Remove item combos. . .

Basic tool enchantments...
Silk touch, Fortune, Unbreaking, Efficiency, Mending

Additional weapon enchantments?
Sharpness, Sweeping edge?
